## Design Principles

WeNexus design follows these core principles:

1. **Clarity** - Information should be clear and easy to understand
2. **Accessibility** - Design for all users, including those with disabilities

4. **Consensus-Focused** - Design promotes understanding and agreement
5. **Scalability** - Design system scales for future growth

## File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for all file names
- Include version numbers for iterative designs: `component-v1.2.fig`
- Use descriptive names: `user-profile-dashboard-mockup.fig`
- Include platform indicators: `mobile-navigation-wireframe.fig`

## Design Tools

- **Primary**: Figma for UI/UX design and prototyping
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
- **Handoff**: Design tokens exported to code
- **Version Control**: Figma file versioning + Git for exported assets
