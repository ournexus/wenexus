# Knowledge Graph Extraction Integration - Product Specification

https://github.com/stair-lab/kg-gen

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the integration of knowledge graph extraction capabilities into WeNexus,
leveraging natural language processing to automatically extract and structure knowledge from
discussions, articles, and user-generated content. This capability will enhance WeNexus's mission of
bridging information gaps by creating intelligent connections between concepts, arguments, and
perspectives.

## Product Vision

Transform WeNexus from a discussion platform into an intelligent knowledge synthesis system that
automatically discovers, structures, and visualizes the relationships between ideas, arguments, and
evidence shared within the community.

## Background & Opportunity

Traditional discussion platforms treat conversations as linear threads, losing the rich semantic
relationships between concepts. Knowledge graph extraction can:

1. **Preserve Intellectual Connections**: Maintain relationships between ideas across time
2. **Reveal Hidden Patterns**: Surface consensus areas and points of divergence
3. **Accelerate Understanding**: Help users quickly grasp complex topic landscapes
4. **Bridge Knowledge Gaps**: Connect related discussions across different contexts

## Technical Foundation

Based on state-of-the-art knowledge graph extraction research, the system will employ:

### Core Capabilities

- **Entity Recognition**: Identify key concepts, people, organizations, and ideas
- **Relationship Extrac tion**: Discover how entities relate to each other (supports, contradicts,
  refines, etc.)
- **Semantic Classification**: Categorize relationships by type (causal, comparative, evidentiary)
- **Temporal Tracking**: Track how relationships evolve over time
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provide reliability scores for extracted relationships

### Supported Input Formats

- Discussion posts and comments
- Linked articles and documents
- User-generated summaries
- External content imports
- Multimedia content with transcripts

### Output Structures

- **Entity Graphs**: Nodes representing concepts with metadata
- **Relationship Networks**: Edges showing connections with strength/confidence
- **Temporal Views**: How knowledge structures change over time
- **Consensus Maps**: Areas of agreement vs. disagreement
- **Knowledge Pathways**: Chains of reasoning and evidence
