# WeNexus: The Consensus Amplifier

WeNexus is a platform designed to bridge information gaps and create meaningful connections in an age of information overload and polarizing echo chambers. We don't just need another network; we need a Nexus - a central point where We, as a society, can finally connect, understand, and agree.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing all WeNexus applications and services:
